# Medical Dashboard React Prototype 2018
See the design prototype [Live Here](http://alanthinks.com/projects/medical-audit-app)

This application became a comprehensive internal audit management tool developed for one of the largest healthcare companies in the United States.

I later developed comprehensive solutions applied in the **Memorial Healthcare System** in the areas of `Radiology`, `Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU)`, `Operating Room Scheduling`, `New Doctor Onboarding` and much more. These are software solutions used by 1,000s of physicians across the country.

### Overview
The Medical Audit App features a user-friendly interface and multiple components that showcase CRUD functionality and dynamic content rendering. The goal was to create a scalable and maintainable codebase while delivering a visually appealing design.

### Key Features
- **Weekly Performance Overview:** Visual progress indicators for team members, providing quick insights into weekly performance metrics.
- **My Tasks:** Task management system, displaying tasks in an organized list format, allowing users to track and update progress easily.
- **Team Summary:** A detailed team performance section, highlighting the top performer of the month, team averages, and categorized task statuses.
- **My Queue:** A visual representation of pending tasks, integrated with dynamic content updates for real-time monitoring.

### Design and Implementation
I was responsible for the full design and development cycle, including:

- **Wireframing & Prototyping:** Conceptualized and designed interactive wireframes, ensuring an intuitive user experience.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Developed reusable and efficient React components to promote modularity and code reusability.
- **Context API for State Management:** Leveraged Reactâ€™s Context API to manage global state, making data accessible across multiple components seamlessly.
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented media queries to ensure optimal display across various screen sizes and devices.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management:** Context API
- **Styling:** Custom CSS, responsive design techniques
- **Media Query Integration:** Enhanced layout adaptability for different screen resolutions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
